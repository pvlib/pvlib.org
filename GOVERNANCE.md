## The Project
The pvlib project (The Project) is an open source software project. The goal of The Project is to
develop open source software for modeling and analyzing the performance of photovoltaic (PV) energy
systems. The Software developed by The Project is released under the BSD (or similar) open source
license, developed openly, and hosted in public GitHub repositories under the pvlib GitHub
organization. Examples of Project Software include the main pvlib-python code repository as well as
the pvanalytics and twoaxistracking code repositories.

The Project is developed by a team of distributed developers, called Contributors. Contributors are
individuals who have contributed code, documentation, designs, or other work to one or more Project
repositories. Many of the Contributors are listed in the change logs of the repositories of the
pvlib project. Anyone can be a Contributor. Contributors can be affiliated with any legal entity or
none. The foundation of Project participation is openness and transparency.

The project community consists of all Contributors and Users of The Project. We strive to keep the
barrier between Contributors and Users as low as possible.

## Governance
This section describes the governance and leadership model of The Project. The foundations of
Project governance are:

- Openness and Transparency
- Active Contribution
- Institutional Neutrality

## Core Team
The Core Team is the group of trusted individuals who manage pvlib. They assume many roles required
to achieve The Project’s goals, especially those that require a high level of trust. They make the
decisions that shape the future of The Project.

Core Team members are expected to act as role models for the community and custodians of The
Project, on behalf of the community and all those who rely on pvlib.

They have authority over the pvlib project infrastructure, including the pvlib Project website
itself, the pvlib GitHub organization and repositories, the mailing lists, IRC channels, etc.

The Core Team and its Members play a special role in certain situations. In particular, the Core
Team may:

- Make decisions about the overall scope, vision, and direction of The Project.
- Make decisions about strategic collaborations with other organizations or individuals.
- Grant commit rights to code repositories.
- Make decisions about controversial technical issues, features, bugs, and pull requests.
- Make decisions about the Services that are run by The Project and manage those Services for the
  benefit of The Project and Community.
- Make decisions when regular community discussion doesn’t produce consensus in a reasonable time.


### Decision making
The Core Team’s goal is to reach all decisions by consensus. Our goal is to ensure that those
affected by and involved in any given change can contribute with confidence and that their voices
will be heard. Thoughtful review from a broad community is the best mechanism for creating
high-quality software.

However, consensus does not require waiting for everybody’s opinion on every change. For example,
on a day-to-day basis, many small decisions will nevertheless be made by individuals or small
numbers of individuals in the core team. Any Core Team Member may explicitly elevate an upcoming
change or activity for consideration by the Core Team or request a retroactive review of a recent
change or activity.

In cases where consensus cannot be reached, the Core Team may vote. Resolution by voting is not
desired and should only be used in exceptional cases. Every Core Team member must either vote or
abstain. Passing requires a strict majority of non-abstaining members. Whenever possible, the Core
Team’s deliberations and votes shall be public.

### Core Team Membership
To be eligible to be a member of the Core Team, an individual must be a Project Contributor who has
produced contributions that are substantial in quality and quantity, and sustained over at least
one year. Potential Core Team members are nominated by existing Core members and approved by the
existing Core Team. Core team members may resign at any time.

When considering potential Members, the Core Team will look at candidates with a comprehensive view
of their contributions, to include: code, code review, infrastructure work, mailing list and chat
participation, community help/building, education and outreach, design work, etc. We encourage
diversity in background, viewpoint, and skill, which is why we do not define code as the sole
metric on which Core Team membership will be evaluated.

Core Team members should demonstrate:

- a good grasp of the philosophy of the pvlib Project
- a solid track record of being constructive and helpful
- significant contributions to The Project’s goals, in any form
- willingness to dedicate some time to improving pvlib

Core Team members are always looking for promising contributors, teaching them how The Project is
managed, and considering them for membership of the Core Team when they’re ready.

The Core Team reserves the right to eject current Members and exclude Contributors if they are
deemed actively harmful to The Project’s well-being, and attempts at communication and conflict
resolution have failed.

The initial Core Team members as of May 2025 will consist of the existing members of the GitHub
pvlib organization: Adam R. Jensen, Anton Driesse, Cliff Hansen, Kevin Anderson, Kirsten Perry,
Mark Mikofski, and William Holmgren.

## Changing this document
As with all project decisions, changes to this document should preferably be reached by consensus.
If this is not possible, changes to this document require at least a two-thirds majority of votes
cast in a Core Team vote, which should be open for two weeks.
